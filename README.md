# Implement Devise using BDD
 
This repo consists of a series of commits which implement the [Devise Gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) using Behavior Driven Development.

Devise is an important Gem within the Ruby on Rails community.  Many sites use it to provide user registration (sign up) and session management (being able to sign in to your app).  Sign in and sign up is a necessary component of most web applications you will work on in your career.

The starting point for this module is the code created in the [Rails Getting Started](https://github.com/software-
academy/rails_getting_started_bdd) repo.

After each step in this module, you should be committing your work at each step.  It's important to be well practiced at having granular, orderly, and descriptive commit messages. This is especially important when working with a team.
